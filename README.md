# Teen Beach Moonta — who's where

Everyone at the camp is somewhere. They're on site, they're at one of the
programme's activities, or they've signed out of camp. Scan a lanyard and they
move —
there's no separate sign out and sign in to fall out of step with each other.

Runs on Cloudflare Workers with a D1 database and deploys from GitHub on every
push.

- **Scan** — pick where they're going, scan a lanyard, done. **On site** and
  **Signing out** are the two big buttons; under them is one day of the
  programme at a time (finished activities fold away). Whatever's picked is
  shown right above the scan box. The one box takes a scanner, a typed code or
  a typed name.
- **Who's where** — live counts and everyone grouped by the place they're at,
  with anyone past an off-site activity's return time flagged.
- **Programme** — all four days are loaded from the Branch Moot schedule, each
  activity marked on site or off site. Tap any activity to change or delete it,
  or add your own.
- **People** — everyone gets a six character code as a QR code *and* a barcode.
  Printable card sheet (important numbers on the back), phone image, or their
  own web page with their barcode and the numbers to call.

## 1. Get the code onto GitHub

```bash
cd teen-beach-moonta
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Teen Beach Moonta camp board"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/teen-beach-moonta.git
git push -u origin main
```

(Or make an empty repo on github.com and drag these files into the web uploader.)

## 2. Install the tools and log in

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

```bash
npm install
npx wrangler login
```

## 3. Make the database

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create teenbeach
```

It prints a `database_id`. Open **wrangler.jsonc** and paste it over the
`database_id` that's already there, then create the tables and load the
programme:

```bash
npm run db:remote
```

> `schema.sql` drops every table before it rebuilds them, so running it a second
> time wipes the roster along with everything else. Run it once at setup, and
> again only when you really do want to start from scratch.
>
> If you already have a database from an earlier version of this Worker, you
> don't need to re-run it. The Worker upgrades the tables in place the first
> time it's asked for anything, keeping everyone's codes and where they are.
> Your existing activities come across marked **on site** — open the Programme
> tab and fix any that are actually off site.

Commit and push that change — `git add . && git commit -m "database id" && git push`.

## 4. Deploy

**From GitHub (recommended, so every push goes live):**
Cloudflare dashboard → **Compute (Workers)** → **Create** → **Import a repository**
→ choose your repo. Leave the build command empty and set the deploy command to
`npx wrangler deploy`. Cloudflare builds and deploys it, then redeploys on every
push to `main`.

**Or straight from your laptop:**

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Either way you end up with `https://teen-beach-moonta.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.
You can add a custom domain later under the Worker's **Settings → Domains & Routes**.

## 5. Lock it with a staff PIN

```bash
npx wrangler secret put STAFF_PIN
```

Type a PIN when prompted. Everyone on the desk enters it once per device. Without
this secret the board is open to anyone with the link — fine while you're testing,
not for the camp.

## 6. Run the camp

1. **People** → **Paste a whole list** (`Name, Crew` per line) → **Download
   lanyard cards** → print double sided (flip on the long edge) at 100% and cut.
   Portrait, 60 × 85 mm, nine to a page, printed over the camp artwork. The
   back is the important numbers sheet (`public/card-back.webp`) — if a number
   changes, replace that image as well as `CONTACTS` at the top of
   `src/index.js` (which feeds everyone's own page and the first aid line on
   the front).

   ```
   Alex Moreno, Aurora Rover Unit
   Sam Whitlock, Attunga Rover Unit
   Priya Raman, Cove Rover Unit
   ```

2. Send each person `https://your-site/p/THEIRCODE` (**Card** → **Copy their
   link**). Their page shows their barcode and code (for a USB scanner, or to
   type in) and the numbers to call. The printed lanyard still has the QR code
   for the camera.
3. On the **Scan** tab: pick where they're going, scan, repeat. A $30 USB barcode scanner
   is the most reliable option — it just types the code and presses enter. The
   camera and the search-by-name fallback both work too.

### On a phone

The board never grabs focus on a touch device, so the on-screen keyboard stays
shut while you're scanning. **Camera** sits next to the scan box, and the box
only opens the keyboard if you tap it on purpose. After each scan the result
pops up at the bottom of the screen.

### On site and off site

Each activity is marked on site or off site. Off-site ones are what the "off
site" count and the "past their return time" flag are built on — so when you add
an activity of your own, set that field correctly.

## Running it locally

```bash
npm run db:local     # build the tables in a local copy of the database
npm run dev          # http://localhost:8787
```

## What costs money

| | |
|---|---|
| Cloudflare Workers + D1 | Free tier is far more than a camp needs |
| Domain name | Optional; the `workers.dev` address works fine |

## Files

```
public/index.html   the board (markup + styles)
public/app.js       all the front end logic

public/vendor/      QR generator, QR scanner, barcode generator
src/index.js        the Worker: API, person pages, static assets
schema.sql          database tables and the four day programme
wrangler.jsonc      Cloudflare settings
